I made a home-made Speech recognition, for these reasons:
-	In lockdown, me and more people are using the PC again. I am a slow writer, so I need some help. And I was searching but I can´t find any alternative.
-	I knew a powerful and simple tool to convert speech: Speech recognition API of chrome navigator, and I noticed how easy could be do my own dictation system. I am a Microsoft guy, and usually prefere its products but google speech recognition is a great tool.
-	I wanted to make a JavaScript example with clipboard handling.
-	And later I saw Git pages and  wanted to test them to run a page hosted in Git.

The tool is very simple:
-	Open the site, select your language, and begin to speak. You´ll see the transcription in text area bellow. 
-	If “Copy to Clipboard” is checked all the text content will be copied to the Clipboard automatically.
-	If you want to start again, push “Start” button.
 To execute in web go to https://jalmarazmartn.github.io/SpeechToClipboard/SpeechToText.html
 Advice: I don´t recommend execute directly from the Hub, works better if you copy to your PC the Html file.
